# Bedrock warp addon
Bassicly just adds warps to minecraft bedrock.
I decided to make this open source to let everyone just make their desired amount of warps.

# Setting everything up
First of all you will need mcreator. I used version 2020.4 so i guess version 2020.5 works fine too

You can simply choose to make your world have only one warp but to make multiple warps, you'll have to:

1) Copy and paste every file that is already in the project (so it would be: Delwarp1 ; Setwarp1 ; Warp1). There is a button on the side to do so.

2) Then you want to make changes in the files you just made. replace every time you see "warp_1" by what ever you want to call it (its just so the files dont get merged together.

3) Then click on save mod element.

4) Once you did all these changes, you can click on the green start button on your top-right to launch the game

5) In-game, just create a new map, add the resource pack and behaviour pack (they shoud both be called warp addon) and tick the mark with allow experimental features

6) That's it!

# How to use in-game

To create a warp, u'll simply have to type in chat "/function "the name u gave to your setwarp"" (an example: /function setwarp_1 ).
To got to warp and to delwarp, replace "the name you gave to your set warp" , to what ever you gave the name of your delwarp and warp".

Doing the /function setwarp_1 command will place a glass block next to you and this will be your spawn beacon.

Doing the /function warp_1 commad will tp you to the block

Doing the /function delwarp_1 command will just kill the entity and you simply have to break the glass block

Btw, the invisibility and slowness set on the mob won't last for ever so unless you want a mob to roam around freely, you should run the delwarp and setwarp command once again


That's pretty much it.

Thank you for maybe downloading this addon 

And please don't try to repost it claiming it is your addon. I took time on this even tho it is not a lot of code but i had to test and do multiple fails

Anyways cya
